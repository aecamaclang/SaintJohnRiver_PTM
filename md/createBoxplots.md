Plot Standardized Benefit Estimates
================
Adapted for the SJR PTM by Abbey Camaclang
10 Jul 2019

Based on *Boxplot\_script.R* from FRE PTM project This script creates two plots for each Ecological Group:
1) boxplots of the best guess, lower, and upper estimates for each Strategy from all Experts;
2) pointrange plots showing the best guess, lower and upper estimates of each Expert for each Strategy.
NOTE: need to create 2 subfolders named 'boxplots' and 'pointrange' where plots will be saved.

It requires output from *standardizeConfidence.R*, which standardizes the individual estimates to 80% confidence level and saves results as **Estimates\_std\_long.csv**

Load packages

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(gridExtra)
library(here)
```

Read in data from benefits aggregation

``` r
subfolder <- here("results")
rlong.std <- read_csv(paste0(subfolder, "/Estimates_std_long.csv")) # use read_csv to make sure factors read in as character
```

Prepare data for plotting

``` r
strat.levels <- unique(rlong.std$Strategy)
grp.levels <- unique(rlong.std$Ecological.Group)
est.levels <- c("Lower", "Best.Guess", "Upper")
expcode <- unique(rlong.std$Expert) 

# Order the strategies to plot in the desired order
rlong.std$Strategy <- factor(rlong.std$Strategy, levels = strat.levels)

# Subset to remove confidence estimates
rlong.std <- subset(rlong.std, Est.Type %in% c("Best.Guess", "Lower", "Upper"))
rlong.std$Est.Type <- factor(rlong.std$Est.Type, levels = est.levels)
```

Boxplots
--------

Plot group estimates as boxplots and save as .pdf

``` r
for (j in seq_along(expcode)) {
  
  grp.list <- list()
  
  for (i in seq_along(grp.levels)) {
    
    temp.grpdata <- subset(rlong.std, Ecological.Group == grp.levels[i])
    temp.plot <-
      ggplot(temp.grpdata, aes(x = Est.Type, # for each Ecological group, plot Estimate Type on x-axis 
                               y = St.Value, # and St.Value on y-axis, 
                               fill = Est.Type) # and colour the boxplots by estimate type
             ) + 
      geom_boxplot() + # tell R to display data in boxplot form
      geom_point(data = subset(temp.grpdata, Expert == expcode[j]), # plot indiv. expert's estimates as blue datapoints on top of the boxplots

Pointrange plots
